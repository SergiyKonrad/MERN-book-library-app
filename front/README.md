## Overview

The **MERN Book Library App** allows users to:

- View a collection of books
- Fetch a random book or a delayed random book via API
- Add new books through a form
- Mark books as favorites
- Possibility to integrate books from external libraries, such as Open Library

This project demonstrates the use of RESTful APIs, MongoDB for data persistence, and React for a responsive frontend interface.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Seamless updates between frontend and backend using RESTful APIs.
- **Add New Books**: Add books manually or import book details from Open Library.
- **Random Book Fetch**: Fetches a random book from the collection.
- **Display All Books**: View a list of all books in the MongoDB collection.
- **Possibility to API Integration**: Pull in book data from Open Library using work IDs.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux for state management, Axios for API requests, CSS for styling
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **External Libraries**: Open Library API (for external book data)

### Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mern-book-library-app.git
   cd mern-book-library-app
   ```
2. **Install Backend Dependencies**

```bash
cd back-api
npm install
```

3. **Install Frontend Dependencies**

```bash
cd ../front
npm install
```

4. **Setup MongoDB Connection**

Create a `.env` file in the `back-api` directory with your MongoDB connection URI:

```plaintext
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/booklibraryrecommended
```

Replace <username>, <password>, and <cluster> with your MongoDB credentials and cluster information.

### Run the Application

**Backend:**

```bash
cd back-api
npm start
```

**Frontend:**

```bash
cd ../front
npm start

```

### Access the App:

- Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the frontend.
- The backend runs on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).

## Usage

- **Fetch All Books**  
  Open the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view all available books.

- **Add a New Book**  
  Use the "Add Book" form on the frontend to manually add a new book.

- **Fetch Random Book**  
  Use the "Random Book" button on the frontend to fetch a randomly selected book.

- **Possibility to Import from Open Library**  
  POST a new book by entering the Open Library Work ID to `http://localhost:5000/add-book/:workId`.

## API Endpoints
