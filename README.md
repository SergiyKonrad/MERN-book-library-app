# MERN Book Library App ðŸ“š

A full-stack web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack and Redux for state management. The MERN Book Library App allows users to browse, add, delete, and view details of books in a centralized library collection.

Explore the full project at [MERN Book Library App](https://mern-book-library-app.vercel.app/).

## Overview

The **MERN Book Library App** allows users to:

- View a collection of books
- Fetch a random book or a delayed random book via API
- Add new books through a form
- Mark books as favorites
- Integrate books from external libraries, such as Open Library

This project demonstrates the use of RESTful APIs, MongoDB for data persistence, and React for a responsive frontend interface.

## Project Structure

This repository contains both the backend (`api/`) and frontend (`front/`) codebases within a single main repository. This setup allows for a clear separation of concerns while keeping the entire project in one place for easier management.

### Code Structure

- **`api/`** - Contains the backend API built with Node.js and Express, responsible for server-side logic, database interactions, and API endpoints.
- **`front/`** - Contains the frontend application built with React, handling the user interface and client-side interactions.

## Deployment

- **Frontend**: Hosted on [Vercel](https://mern-book-library-app.vercel.app/)
- **Backend**: Hosted on Render and linked to the frontend for seamless API integration

## Features

- **Browse Books**: View all books in the library with relevant details.
- **Add New Books**: Add books manually or import book details from Open Library or an external library API.
- **Fetch Recommended**:  
  _This feature runs only on the frontend and adds a predefined recommended book to your collection._
- **Add Random Book via API**:  
  _Uses the backend to fetch a random book from the MongoDB database._
- **Random Book Fetch**: Fetches a random book from the collection.
- **Delete Books**: Remove books from the collection with a single click.
- **Possibility to API Integration**: Pull in book data from Open Library using work IDs.
- **Redux State Management**: Efficiently manage application state, ensuring responsive and dynamic updates.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux for state management, Axios for API requests, CSS for styling
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **External Libraries**: Open Library API (for external book data)

## Setup & Installation

1. **_Clone the repository_**:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/SergiyKonrad/MERN-book-library-app.git
   ```
   ```
   cd mern-book-library-app
   ```
2. **_Install Backend Dependencies_**

```bash
cd api
```

```
   npm install
```

4. **_Install Frontend Dependencies_**

```bash
cd ../front
```

```
   npm install
```

4. **_Setup MongoDB Connection_**

Create a `.env` file in the `back-api` directory with your MongoDB connection URI:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/booklibraryrecommended
```

Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<cluster>` with your MongoDB credentials and cluster information.

### Run the Application

**_Backend:_**

```bash
cd api
```

```
npm start
```

**_Frontend:_**

```bash
cd ../front
```

```
npm start
```

## Access the App:

- Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the frontend.
- The backend runs on [http://localhost:5000/books](http://localhost:5000/books) to fetch all books.
- Additional endpoints include:
  - `/random-book`: Fetch a random book.
  - `/random-book-delayed`: Fetch a delayed random book.
  - `/add-book/:workId`: Add a book from Open Library by work ID.

### API Endpoints

| Endpoint               | Method | Description                        |
| ---------------------- | ------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `/books`               | GET    | Fetch all books                    |
| `/random-book`         | GET    | Fetch a random book                |
| `/random-book-delayed` | GET    | Fetch a delayed random book        |
| `/add-book/:workId`    | POST   | Add a book from Open Library by ID |
