# MERN Book Library App ðŸ“š

A full-stack web application built with the MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack, designed to manage a book library, enabling users to browse, add, delete, and view details of books in the collection.

## Overview

The **MERN Book Library App** allows users to:

- View a collection of books
- Fetch a random book or a delayed random book via API
- Add new books through a form
- Mark books as favorites
- Possibility to integrate books from external libraries, such as Open Library

This project demonstrates the use of RESTful APIs, MongoDB for data persistence, and React for a responsive frontend interface.

## Features

- **Real-Time Updates**: Seamless updates between frontend and backend using RESTful APIs.
- **Add New Books**: Add books manually or import book details from Open Library.
- **Random Book Fetch**: Fetches a random book from the collection.
- **Display All Books**: View a list of all books in the MongoDB collection.
- **Possibility to API Integration**: Pull in book data from Open Library using work IDs.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**: React, Redux for state management, Axios for API requests, CSS for styling
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose ODM
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **External Libraries**: Open Library API (for external book data)

### Setup & Installation

1. ***Clone the repository***:
   ```bash
   https://github.com/SergiyKonrad/MERN-book-library-app.git
   ```
   ```
   cd mern-book-library-app
   ```
2. ***Install Backend Dependencies*** 
 ```bash
cd back-api
```
```
   npm install
```
4. ***Install Frontend Dependencies***
 ```bash
cd ../front
```
```
   npm install
```
4. ***Setup MongoDB Connection***

Create a `.env` file in the `back-api` directory with your MongoDB connection URI:

```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<cluster>.mongodb.net/booklibraryrecommended
```

Replace `<username>`, `<password>`, and `<cluster>` with your MongoDB credentials and cluster information.

### Run the Application

***Backend:***
 ```bash
cd back-api
```
```
npm start
```
***Frontend:***
 ```bash
cd ../front
```
```
npm start
```
### Access the App:

- Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) for the frontend.
- The backend runs on [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).
